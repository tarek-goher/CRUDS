# CRUDS
<p>
  This project is a Product Management System built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create, update, delete, and search for products, with the total price calculated based on price, taxes, ads, and discounts. The data is stored locally using localStorage so that it persists even after the page is refreshed. The system has a user-friendly interface with a toggle between dark and light themes. Users can input details such as title, price, and category, and the data is displayed in a table with the ability to search by title or category.

Features:

Add, update, and delete products.
Calculate total price based on inputs.
Light and dark mode support.
